/*

create a common component which does most of the work of setting up



<neural-container
	x="10"
	y="10"
	width="160"
	height="120"
>
	<img src="./example1.png"></img>
	<img src="./example2.png"></img>
	<img src="./example3.png"></img>
	<img src="./example4.png"></img>
</neural-container>


this would create a basic experiment page like seen in cnn/index.html

the javascript to support this page would then be focused only on network

would be even nicer if this component could expose methods for traversing pixels with read/write ops
