I want to add super-advanced neurons which do way more than just track a weight and bias

I want to visualize the network state

I want to run a network in reverse: (deep dream?)

Modified:

- fix minor errors
- setting for weight init, bias init
- setting for common activation functions (and their derivative)
- per layer weight, bias, activation functions
- setting for different kinds of networks
